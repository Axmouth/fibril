# Replication and Sharding Work Log

Branch: `replication-sharding-plan`

This is the running feature log for replication, partition ownership, and
sharding work. It should record what was tried, what was rejected, what worked,
and what remains pending.

## Starting Direction

Replication and sharding should be designed as one cluster model:

- a partition has exactly one owner serving client traffic
- a partition can have multiple followers applying replicated data
- a node can own many partitions and follow many other partitions
- coordination decides ownership and follower assignment
- Keratin remains a local log library, unaware of peers or elections
- Stroma owns queue role behavior, because queue semantics live there
- Fibril broker routes client traffic to the owner or returns a not-owner error

The first implementation focus should be replication-safe storage primitives,
not network transport. If a follower cannot apply leader-assigned offsets
locally, every higher layer would be built on the wrong foundation.

## Current Findings

- Keratin currently assigns offsets inside `Log::stage_append` and
  `Log::stage_append_batch`.
- Keratin records already store offsets on disk, and readers can scan/fetch
  records with offsets.
- The missing primitive is an append path that accepts caller-provided offsets,
  validates the range, and writes the records without assigning new offsets.
- Stroma currently writes message records first, then appends events that refer
  to those message offsets. This can support replication as long as delivery
  remains event-log driven.
- Stroma queue handles are per `(topic, partition, group)`, which is compatible
  with per-partition role and ownership.

## Decisions

- Use external coordination long-term, with etcd as the likely target.
- Static config is acceptable for the first local/in-process milestone if it
  does not leak into the storage or queue APIs.
- Replication is pull-oriented unless later evidence says otherwise.
- Followers must not assign offsets.
- Followers must not run independent queue-time decisions such as expiry or DLQ
  spawning.
- Do not expose offsets as client-facing routing concepts.

## Pending Decisions

- Exact epoch persistence location in Keratin, Stroma, or both.
- Whether Keratin epoch tracking is a manifest field, separate metadata file, or
  both.
- Exact name and shape of replicated append APIs.
- How much snapshot installation belongs in Keratin versus Stroma.
- First sharding metadata shape for static config and later etcd.
- Not-owner error shape and topology refresh story for clients.

## Proposed First Milestones

1. Add Keratin replicated append primitives and tests.
2. Add Keratin epoch metadata and stale-epoch rejection.
3. Add Stroma queue role and write rejection on follower.
4. Add role-aware Stroma background tasks.
5. Add in-process leader/follower replication test with fake transport.
6. Add broker partition ownership routing with static config.
7. Add not-owner errors and client retry/topology refresh hooks.
8. Add real coordination and replication transport.

## Things Not To Do Yet

- Do not build automatic failover first.
- Do not put networking or coordination into Keratin.
- Do not make followers serve reads.
- Do not build around client-visible offsets.
- Do not optimize replication throughput before correctness tests exist.

## Log

- 2026-06-09: Created feature branch in Fibril and Keratin. Read
  `REPLICATION_PLANNING.md` and inspected Keratin append/read paths plus Stroma
  queue append paths. Conclusion: first useful slice is Keratin replicated
  append with explicit offsets and gap rejection.
